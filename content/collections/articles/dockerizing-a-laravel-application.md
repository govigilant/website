title: 'Dockerizing a Laravel Octane application'
introduction: "Deploying a Laravel application can be difficult for those who don't have experience with PHP applications. Docker is the solution to easily publish and let other people deploy your application without them needing to learn how it is exactly setup. In this article I will show how I've Dockerized Vigilant."

        text: 'The traditional setup process can be error-prone, requiring configuration in multiple applications (nginx, php, mysql, redis). This is not good if you want other people, who may not be familiar with PHP applications, to host your app. For example, what if you add a dependency in a later version of your application? With a traditional setup, everyone upgrading must remember to install that dependency. '
